            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Ouyang Qionghua Guzheng Teaching Center was established in 2004. Its main purpose is to inherit and promote traditional Chinese guzheng music and to engage in cultural exchanges with various countries. In 2011, the center expanded to include additional Chinese music and cultural courses, such as traditional Chinese painting, calligraphy, and dough figurine making. Besides guzheng, the music courses now also offer erhu, yangqin, pipa, and guqin. (After the pandemic, the focus has been mainly on guzheng and erhu courses.)</p>
            <p>Since 2011, the center has been hosting the external grading exams of the China Conservatory of Music. Teacher Ouyang Qionghua was appointed by the grading committee as the director of the East Coast office. The exams are held once a year and have been conducted for over ten years.</p>

                <img src="grace_ou.png" alt="Portrait of Grace Chang" class="faculty-portrait">
                <p>Grace Chang, an expert of guzheng (Chinese harp), studied under Wei De-Liang, Wei De-Dong, and Chen Kuo-Xing (the earliest guzheng pioneers in Taiwan); and Chang Yan, Wan Chang-yuan, and Liu Wei-Shan (the most renowned master teachers in China). She has performed at such venues as the Permanent Mission of the People’s Republic of China to the United Nations (NYC), the Queens Museum of Art, Fortunoff Theatre (Hofstra University), Ford’s Theatre (Washington, D.C.), and Berkeley Repertory Theatre (California). Grace has also recorded two solo CDs titled “Water Lilies” and “Floating Moon”.</p>
                <p>In 2004, Grace established the Chinese Harp Music and Cultural Center in Queens, New York, where she is the director and main teacher. She also established the New York Chinese Harp Music Ensemble, which has performed at Lincoln Center, at Westchester County Center, and at the Taiwan Economic and Cultural Embassy in New York (as well as at many local fundraising events in the community). In 2011, Grace was certified by the China Conservatory of Music (the highest authority of Chinese traditional music) as the East Coast Director and Administrator of their Grade Level Exams. Her Music Center is the only location on the East Coast of the United States that students can take the official graded examination.</p>
                <p>Deeply passionate as a performer and educator, she hopes to continue to bring Chinese music and culture to a larger American audience.</p>
